# AN IMPERIAL SIMULATION [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fbdb6335-65d3-42f4-84ec-c7ba2034f20f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/an-imperial-simulation/deploys)

This is a strategy game about building an empire and managing resources. Assign workers to different jobs around your city; enter into league with ancient forces; arm soldiers to defend your walls from raiders; raise and train heroes to venture out and quest in your name, and uncover the secrets of the world around you.

The goal is to build a final Monument that will be your crowning achievment. Mount it with a capstone to complete the structure. These capstones range from the mundane to the legendary, and will determine the weight of your legacy.
