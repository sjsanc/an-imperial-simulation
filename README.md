# IMPSIM

> Each structure has multiple jobs
> Each job can have multiple citizens assigned
> Each job has a product per second. If a product per second is less than 0, then it takes longer than a second to complete job.
> Each job has a consumption per second. Per completion, a set amount of consumption occurs. If a product has a greater-than-second duration, then consumption targets must be met for each tick. If resources fall below consumption target, production halts.
> No progress bars
> Jobs are set to a desired capacity. if a citizen dies, another will take its place. If no citizens are available to take place, Job will display an error. Citizens are assigned in the normal tick cycle. Which means if population can handle capacity, no production will be affected.
> Each active worker multiplies the per tick outcome.
> Because each tick is 1 second, citizens can be added or taken away without affecting product status
> Count dictates job capacity in most cases. A count of 3 allows for 3 workers per job, unless specified otherwise.
> If output box overflows, click to revela total output
> Structures can have either/or upgrades that come in pairs and lock the other out
