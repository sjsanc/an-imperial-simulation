### AN IMPERIAL SIMULATION

A colony management incremental sim game based - in part - on Ortiel's [NeverEnding Legacy](http://orteil.dashnet.org/legacy/). 

Assign your citizens to jobs, construct a myriad of buildings, marshall fierce armies and build a settlement that will stand the test of time. Only the hardiest of Empires will be able to uncover the many secrets of this Continent...

#### Design

Currently being built with React with Redux and Redux Toolkit. This is also my first project to use Webpack without the create-react-app bootstrapper. So far so good.
